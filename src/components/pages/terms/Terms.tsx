                            into a new investment if a liquidation event is not initiated by you

                            investments you have on Loanith. If you accept such customized credit
                            offer, and if same is in arrears on the maturity or early redemption
                            date of the specific investment which formed the basis of the credit
                            offer, you agree and authorize Loanith to take a portion of the
                            investment and use same to offset the outstanding loan. Where the
                            investment amount on the maturity or early redemption date is equal to
                            your credit balance, you agree and authorize Loanith to use the entire

                            investment before maturity in the event that the Customer information
                            provided is untrue, inaccurate or incomplete; and you hereby agree to be
                            liable for any costs that may be reasonably incurred by the third party

                            In line with your decision to invest, Loanith has the power to whether
                            directly or commingled with the resources of another person, invest,
                            convert from one form to another, buy, sell, re-invest and manage on

                            Although Loanith and its third-party investment partners carefully
                            evaluate potential returns based on historic performance and collect
                            information on market performances, Loanith, and its third-party
                            investment partners make no representation regarding the likelihood or
                            probability that any actual or proposed investment will in fact achieve
                            a particular outcome or goal.

                            Past performance is not a guarantee of future success, and in fact,
                            volatility means that returns in any period may be far above or below
                            those of the previous period. Investments may lose value. Loanith and
                            its third-party investment partners are unable to predict or forecast
                            market fluctuations or other uncertainties that may affect the value of
                            any investment.

                            You are urged to use all available resources to educate yourself about
                            investing in general, as well as the investments and the overall
                            composition of your account. Additionally, market conditions and your
                            personal financial circumstances may change – perhaps suddenly or
                            gradually over time. Monitoring and adjusting your account to suit
                            changing circumstances is your responsibility, and it is recommended
                            that you reassess any investing program on a regular basis to ensure
                            that it remains consistent with your current financial resources and
                            investment objective.

                            damages (including without limitation lost profits, cost of procuring
                            substitute service or lost opportunity) arising out of or in connection
                            with your decision to invest your savings, whether or not they are made
                            aware of the possibility of such damages.

                                The Lender shall charge a one-time processing fee the first time a
                                Customer sets up a new debit card on the Account. In the event the
                                card is expired or about to expire, you will have to obtain a renewed
                                card from your bank or provide us with another personal debit card.

                                We will never make any transactions on the card outside of the
                                scheduled loan repayments. In the event of a double repayment
                                initiated in error by you, we will on a best effort basis process a
                                refund within a reasonable time.

                    or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
